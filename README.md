## Introduction

This is a package to generate a typesafe router for a gleam web server.

It also provides a typesafe method of linking to paths, so you don't link to invalid pages.

Zero dependencies and works for both `javascript` and `erlang` target!

## Usage

```bash
$ gleam add wayfinder # install package
```



Checkout the [example](https://github.com/daniellionel01/wayfinder/tree/main/example) for a minimal wisp web server setup.

## FAQ

### Is this production ready?

Yes! Feel free to use it in a serious project. I myself use it in side projects and at the company I work at in a production SaaS.
